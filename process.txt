There is no open API to buy stocks directly.
We have to use GPT-3 [Skynet]

1.) we need a backend service so we need firebase app for cloud functions. 
I am not using the cloudfare workers it will not respond correctly and timely that how our bot is responding.

2.) node.js -> GPT-3

GPT = Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 => We will see some tweets according to high algo-traders for having a desicion for buying  a stock.

For buying a stock we need a broker so we using a ALPACA API which is basically a robinhood for developers.
